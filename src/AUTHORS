DGen was originally written by Dave <dave@dtmnt.com>. It was ported to SDL by
Joe Groff <joe@pknet.com> and Phil K. Hornung <falcon@pknet.com>.

It was resurrected by tamentis <tamentis@neopulsar.org> in 2008 and is
maintained by zamaz <zamaz@users.sourceforge.net> since september 2011.

The following people have also made contributions to DGen:

Andrew Bazan <abazan@mailbag.com>
  - Got DGen/SDL to run under BeOS.
Steve Snake <snake@toodarkpark.freeserve.co.uk>

    emulation quirks. ;)

  - Helped add 8-bit sound support. :)
Daniel Wislocki <wislocki@math.grin.edu>
  - Improved the sound engine to be nicer to higher-end systems.
